### FLPP
FLPP is a simple lua-python data structures parser for Blacmagicdesign Fusion files, such as prefs files, macros and comp files.

Check `tests.py` file for some cases specific to Fusion, such as named table values, bracketed string keys and others. 

_TODO_:
* generate fusion tools registry for the NAMED_TABLES automatically
* do not parse floating number keys
